**Direct3d 12 Engine**
This project has been made to help myself (The project owner) and others who are interested in learning Direct3D 12 to get a better understanding of the Graphics API, this will be achieved through me and the community developing this engine, a game using the engine and other tools that will enable the engine to be more user friendly to people who may want to use it to just make a game.

Despite the engine not being at the point of being able to use as a whole product, it is getting the love and attention it needs to become a fully featured game engine that will be completely free.

**Back Story**

The game engine was started in mid-2017 and has been in development ever since. There is a lot of passion, time and effort going into this engine and the best part about it is that it is completely free to use and learn from.

The main purpose for first creating the engine was to help myself learn Direct3D 12, but I started streaming on twitch and got a large number of experienced tips and tricks which aided the project and myself. Then a watcher on twitch suggested to put it on GitHub and open it up to others to help.
